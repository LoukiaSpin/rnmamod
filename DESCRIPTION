Description: A comprehensive suite of functions to perform and visualise 
    pairwise and network meta-analysis with aggregate binary or continuous
    missing participant outcome data. The package covers core Bayesian one-stage
    models implemented in a systematic review with multiple interventions, 
    including fixed-effect and random-effects network meta-analysis, 
    meta-regression, evaluation of the consistency assumption via the 
    node-splitting approach and the unrelated mean effects model, and 
    sensitivity analysis. Missing participant outcome data are addressed in all 
    models of the package. The robustness to primary analysis results can 
    also be investigated using a novel intuitive index (Spineli et al., 2021) 
    <10.1002/jrsm.1478>. Methods to evaluate the transitivity assumption 
    quantitatively are provided. The package also offers a rich, user-friendly 
    visualisation toolkit that aids in appraising and interpreting the results 
    thoroughly and preparing the manuscript for journal submission. 
    The visualisation tools comprise the network plot, forest plots, panel of 
    diagnostic plots, heatmaps on the extent of missing participant outcome data
    in the network, league heatmaps on estimation and prediction, rankograms, 
    Bland-Altman plot, leverage plot, deviance scatterplot, heatmap of 
    robustness, barplot of Kullback-Leibler divergence, heatmap of comparison
    dissimilarities and dendrogram of comparison clustering. The package also 
    allows the user to export the results to an Excel file at the working 
    directory.
