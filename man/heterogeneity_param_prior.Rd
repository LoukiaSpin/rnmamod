\title{Determine the prior distribution for the heterogeneity parameter}
\usage{
heterogeneity_param_prior(measure, model, heter_prior)
}
\arguments{
\item{measure}{Character string indicating the effect measure with values
\code{"OR"}, \code{"MD"}, \code{"SMD"}, or \code{"ROM"} for the odds ratio,
mean difference, standardised mean difference and ratio of means, respectively.}

\item{model}{Character string indicating the analysis model with values
\code{"RE"}, or \code{"FE"} for the random-effects and fixed-effect model,
respectively. The default argument is \code{"RE"}.}

\item{heter_prior}{A list of three elements with the following order:
1) a character string indicating the distribution with (currently available)
values \code{"halfnormal"}, \code{"uniform"}, \code{"lognormal"}, or
\code{"logt"}; 2) two numeric values that refer to the parameters of the
selected distribution.  For \code{"lognormal"}, and \code{"logt"}
these numbers refer to the mean and precision, respectively.
For \code{"halfnorm"}, these numbers refer to zero and the scale parameter
(equal to 0.5 or 1). For \code{"uniform"}, these numbers refer to the
minimum and maximum value of the distribution.}
}
\value{
A value to be passed to \code{\link{run_model}}.
}
\description{
Generates the prior distribution for the between-trial standard deviation
  depending on the selected effect measure.
  \code{heterogeneity_param_prior} is found in the \code{run_model} function;
  thus, the arguments are as specified in the latter.
}
\details{
The names of the (current) prior distributions follow the JAGS syntax.
  The mean and precision of \code{"lognormal"} and \code{"logt"} should align
  with the values proposed by Turner et al. (2015) and Rhodes et al. (2015)
  in the corresponding empirically-based prior distributions when \code{measure}
  is \code{"OR"} or \code{"SMD"}, respectively.
  The users may refer to Dias et al. (2013) to determine the minimum and
  maximum value of the uniform distribution, and to Friede et al. (2017)
  to determine the mean and precision of the half-normal distribution.
  When \code{model} is \code{"FE"}, \code{heterogeneity_param_prior}
  is ignored in the \code{run_model} function.
