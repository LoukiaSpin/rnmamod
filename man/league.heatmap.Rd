\title{League heatmap of all possible comparisons: estimation}
\usage{
league.heatmap(full, drug.names)
}
\arguments{
\item{full}{An object of S3 class \code{\link{run.model}}. See 'Value' in \code{\link{run.model}}.}

\item{drug.names}{A vector of labels with the name of the interventions in the order they appear in the argument \code{data} of \code{\link{run.model}}. If the argument \code{drug.names} is not defined, the order of the interventions
as they appear in \code{data} is used, instead.}
}
\value{
A league heatmap of the posterior mean and 95\% credible interval of all possible comparisons in the off-diagonals, and the posterior mean of the SUCRA values in the diagonal.
}
\description{
A function to create a heatmap with the estimated effects of all possible comparisons of interventions in the network.
\code{league.heatmap} can be used for a random-effects or fixed-effect network meta-analysis.
\code{league.heatmap} is applied for one outcome only.
}
\details{
The rows and columns of the heatmap display the names of interventions which are sorted by decreasing order from the best to the worst
  based on their SUCRA value (Salanti et al., 2011). The off-diagonals contain the posterior mean and 95\% credible interval of the effect measure
  of the corresponding comparisons. The main diagonal contains the SUCRA values of the corresponding interventions.

  Results in the lower triangle refer to comparisons in the opposite direction after converting negative values into positive values (in absolute or logarithmic scale), and vice versa.
  Darker shades of red and blue correspond to larger treatment effects in the upper and lower triangle, respectively, for a beneficial outcome, and the other way around for a harmful outcome.
  Odds ratio and ratio of means are reported in the original scale after exponentiation of the logarithmic scale.

  Comparisons between interventions should be read from left to right.
  Therefore, each cell refers to the corresponding row-defining intervention against the column-defining intervention. Results that indicate strong
  evidence in favor of the row-defining intervention (i.e. the respective 95\% credible interval does not include the null value) are indicated in bold.

  \code{league.heatmap} can be used only for a network of interventions. In the case of two interventions, the execution of the function will be stopped and an error message will be printed in the R console.
