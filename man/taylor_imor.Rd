\title{Pattern-mixture model with Taylor series for binary outcome}
\format{
The columns of the data-frame in the argument \code{data} refer to
  the following ordered elements for a binary outcome:
  \tabular{rl}{
  \bold{id} \tab A unique identifier for each trial.\cr
  \bold{r1} \tab The observed  number of events in the first arm of the
  comparison.\cr
  \bold{r2} \tab The observed  number of events in the second arm of the
  comparison.\cr
  \bold{m1} \tab The number of MOD in the first arm of the comparison.\cr
  \bold{m2} \tab The number of MOD in the second arm of the comparison.\cr
  \bold{n1} \tab The number of participants randomised in the first arm of
  the comparison.\cr
  \bold{n2} \tab The number of participants randomised in the second arm
  of the comparison.\cr
  \bold{t1} \tab An identifier for the intervention in the first arm of
  the comparison.\cr
  \bold{t2} \tab An identifier for the intervention in the second arm of
  the comparison.\cr
  }

\usage{
taylor_imor(data, mean_value, var_value, rho)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data-frame in the long arm-based format. Two-arm trials occupy
one row in the data-frame. Multi-arm trials occupy as many rows as the
number of possible comparisons among the interventions. See 'Format' for
the specification of the columns.}

\item{mean_value}{A numeric value for the mean of the normal distribution of
the informative missingness odds ratio in the logarithmic scale. The same
value is considered for all trial-arms of the dataset. The default argument
is 0 and corresponds to the missing-at-random assumption.}

\item{var_value}{A positive non-zero number for the variance of the normal
distribution of the informative missingness odds ratio in the logarithmic
scale. The default argument is 1.}

\item{rho}{A numeric value in the interval [-1, 1] that indicates the
correlation coefficient between two missingness parameters in a trial. The
same value is considered across all trials of the dataset. The default
argument is 0 and corresponds to uncorrelated missingness parameters.}
}
\value{
A data-frame that additionally includes the following elements:
  \item{EM}{The odds ratio in the logarithmic scale (log OR) adjusted
  for MOD and obtained using the Taylor series.}
  \item{se.EM}{The standard error of the log OR adjusted for MOD and
  obtained using the Taylor series.}
}
\description{
Applies the pattern-mixture model under a specific assumption
  about the informative missingness parameter in trial-arms with
  \bold{binary} missing participant outcome data (MOD) and uses the Taylor
  series to obtain the odds ratio (in the logarithmic scale) and standard
  error for each trial (White et al., 2008).

\details{
The \code{taylor_imor} function is found in the
  \code{\link{unrelated_effects_plot}} function. The latter uses the
  the \code{\link[netmeta:pairwise]{pairwise}} function from the package
  \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=netmeta}{netmeta}
  to transform the dataset from the wide arm-based format into the long-arm
  based format (see, 'Arguments' for \code{data} in
  \code{\link{unrelated_effects_plot}}).
