\title{Heatmap of the risk of bias associated with missing participant outcome data in the network}
\usage{
heatmap.mod.network(data, drug.names)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data-frame of a one-trial-per-row format containing arm-level data of each trial. This format is widely used for BUGS models.
See 'Format' in \code{\link[rnmamod]{run.model}} function for the specification of the columns.}

\item{drug.names}{A vector of labels with the name of the interventions in the order they appear in the argument \code{data}. If the argument \code{drug.names} is not defined, the order of the interventions
as they appear in the argument \code{data} is used, instead.}
}
\value{
The percentage of MOD in each intervention and observed comparison are depicted using white and black colour in the main diagonal and lower off-diagonal, respectively, of the heatmap.
  The percentage of MOD in an intervention is defined as the ratio of the sum of MOD for that intervention across the corresponding trials to the sum of the
  randomised participants in that intervention. Similarly, the percentage of MOD in an observed comparison is the ratio of the sum of MOD for that comparison
  across the corresponding trials to the sum of the randomised participants in that comparison.
  The pairwise comparisons are read from left to right. We used the 'five-and-twenty' rule of Sackett and colleagues to characterise the percentage of MOD as being associated with low (up to 5\%),
  moderate (more than 5\% and up to 20\%), and high risk of bias (more than 20\%). Low, moderate, and high risk of bias associated with MOD is indicated using green, orange, and red colour, respectively.
  The function is also applicable for a pairwise meta-analysis.

\description{
This function illustrates the risk of bias associated with missing participant outcome data (MOD) for each intervention and observed comparison of the network.
