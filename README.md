# rnmamod: package to perform Bayesian network meta-analysis methods

rnmamod is an R package to perform one-stage Bayesian network meta-analysis while adjusting for missing participant outcome data using the pattern-mixture model. The package handles a data-frame of binary and continuous outcome data in the arm-based format. The folliwing effect measures are currently considered: the odds ratio, mean difference, standardised mean difference, and ratio of means. The package comprises a suite of all necessary models for estimation and prediction of the intervention effect, and evaluation of the consistency assumption locally and globally.
