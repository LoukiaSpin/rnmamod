# rnmamod: package to perform Bayesian network meta-analysis methods

rnmamod is an R package to perform one-stage Bayesian network meta-analysis while adjusting for missing participant outcome data using the pattern-mixture model. The package handles a data-frame of binary and continuous outcome data in the arm-based format. The odds ratio, mean difference, standardised mean difference, and ratio of means are currently considered. The pattern-mixture model allows the incorporation of the informative missingness odds ratio for binary outcomes, whilst the informative missingness difference of means and the informative missingness ratio of means for continuous outcomes. The package comprises a suite of all necessary models for estimation and prediction of the intervention effect, and evaluation of the consistency assumption locally and globally. The rnmamod package also includes a rich suite of visualisations that aids the interpretation and accommodation of the results in the submitted research work for publication.
